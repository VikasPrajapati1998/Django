HTTP Request Methods in Django
1. Get Method:
	- The GET Method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the "?" character.
	- https://www.wscubetech.com/index.php?name1=value1&name2=value2
	- Restricted to send upto 1024 characters only.
	- Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive information.
	- Can not be used to send binary data, like images or word documents, to the server.
2.  Post Method:
	- The POST Method transfers information via HTTP headers. The information is encoded as described in case of GET Method and put into a header called QUERY_STRING.
	- Does not have any restriction on data size to be sent.
	- Can be used to send ASCII as well as binary data.
	- The data sent by POST Method goes through HTTP header so security depends on HTTP protocol.
	- By using Secure HTTP you can make sure that your information is secure.
