        <h2>Emerging Trends in AI & ML</h2>
        <p>
            The future of AI is poised to bring advancements in areas like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), where machines
            might reach human-level cognitive abilities. Another major trend is AI democratization, making AI tools and capabilities
            accessible to everyone. Low-code and no-code AI platforms are also expected to empower non-technical users to build
            and deploy AI solutions.

        <h2>Ethical Considerations and Governance</h2>
        <p>
            As AI becomes more powerful, ethical considerations become increasingly important. Ensuring transparency, accountability,
            and fairness in AI systems is essential to prevent harm. Furthermore, regulations and governance frameworks will be
            crucial to manage AIâ€™s impact on jobs, privacy, and security. Future AI systems must align with societal values and
            prioritize ethical considerations to prevent misuse and unintended consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Organizations are beginning to implement AI ethics guidelines, while researchers advocate for AI that complements human
            decision-making rather than replacing it entirely.
