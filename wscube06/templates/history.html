        <h2>The Early Days of AI</h2>
        <p>
            The concept of artificial intelligence dates back to ancient civilizations, where myths spoke of intelligent automatons.
            However, modern AI as a field emerged in the mid-20th century. In 1956, the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined
            at a workshop at Dartmouth College, where pioneers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and others discussed creating
            machines that could "think" like humans.

        <h2>Development of AI & Introduction of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
            During the 1960s and 1970s, AI research continued, though progress was slower than initially anticipated. Early programs
            could solve algebra problems, prove theorems, and mimic human decision-making on a limited scale. However, limitations
            in computing power and data processing hindered further development. The 1980s saw the rise of expert systems,
            which used rule-based logic to emulate decision-making.

        <p>
            Machine Learning (ML) began to gain prominence as researchers started using statistical methods to help machines
            "learn" from data. This shift marked the gradual movement away from rule-based systems toward data-driven approaches.

        <h2>The Modern Era of Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>
            With the advent of more powerful computers, large datasets, and better algorithms, the 2000s brought about a resurgence
            of interest in AI, particularly with the development of Deep Learning. In 2012, a breakthrough occurred when AlexNet, a
            deep neural network, achieved remarkable performance in an image recognition competition, which sparked a new wave of
            research and applications for deep neural networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Deep Learning techniques are central to many AI applications, from computer vision and natural language processing
            to autonomous systems and beyond. The technology continues to evolve rapidly, shaping various industries and everyday life.
